I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Chicago, working with cosmological MHD simulations and particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation of CR acceleration.
My main interest lies in non-thermal processes in galaxy clusters: Cosmic Rays, Magnetic Fields and Turbulence.

I develop the Cosmic Ray model [CRESCENDO](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.519..548B/abstract) for the cosmological Tree-SPH Code **OpenGadget3**.

Most of the time I run and analyze my own simulations for which I developed a number of open source [Software](/repositories/) tools.

I am also part of the [Localization](https://localization.ias.universite-paris-saclay.fr) project where we study the local universe with state-of-the-art constrained initial conditions.

Recently I joined the development team of [entity](https://github.com/entity-toolkit/entity), a particle-in-cell (PIC) code built for exa-scale computing.

Before I went into Astrophysics I was a hobby musician, playing mainly progressive rock (you can listen to one album on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6bg7Ttn08YcNg55pxQz5Fr?si=daKM9MiqQpWzGMDRUThUrw)!)
