I had the great pleasure to give a public outreach talk in the series [Café & Kosmos](https://cafeundkosmos.ph.tum.de/).
It was a great oppurtunity to present my research to a crowd of curious non-experts with only a flipchart at my disposal.
Breaking down my research to make it approachable for people outside of the field while keeping it scientifically correct has been an interesting challenge which I hope to repeat some time again soon.
