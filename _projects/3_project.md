Galaxy clusters are highly dynamic systems with frequent mergers, accretion events abd episodes of feedback by AGN.
This stirrs up the hot intra-cluster medium (ICM) and injects energy at the scale of several hundred of kpc.
This energy is transported down to scales of the Lamour radius of the free electrons and protons in the plasma of the ICM following a turbulent cascade until it dissipates on these smallest scales.

I work with state-of-the art MHD zoom-in simulations of galaxy clusters to study the injection, evolution and dissipation of turbulent energy.
