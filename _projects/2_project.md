High resolution simulations of shocks in galaxy clusters

***

The collision of galaxy clusters are the most energetic events in the universe since the Big Bang.
They are observable as spectacular arcs in the radio-sky, the so-called **radio relics**.

The origin of this radio emission is thought to be relativistic electrons accelerated by the shock, which are loosing their energy in the form of synchrotron emission due to the magnetic field in the intra-cluster medium (ICM).
